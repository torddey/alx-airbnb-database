By using EXPLAIN ANALYZE, it was identified that the initial queries were performing filtering on user_id and property_id after scanning based on the start_date (due to partitioning). Adding indexes on user_id and property_id within each partition allowed the database to directly access the relevant rows using these indexes, significantly reducing the execution time for those specific frequently used queries.
