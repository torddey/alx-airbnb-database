0. Write Complex Queries with Joins

    Objective: Master SQL joins by writing complex queries using different types of joins.

    Instructions:

    Write a query using an INNER JOIN to retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings.

    Write a query using aLEFT JOIN to retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.

    Write a query using a FULL OUTER JOIN to retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.

1. Practice Subqueries
    Objective: Write both correlated and non-correlated subqueries.

    Instructions:

    Write a query to find all properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0 using a subquery.

    Write a correlated subquery to find users who have made more than 3 bookings.

2. Apply Aggregations and Window Functions
    Objective: Use SQL aggregation and window functions to analyze data.

    Instructions:

    Write a query to find the total number of bookings made by each user, using the COUNT function and GROUP BY clause.

    Use a window function (ROW_NUMBER, RANK) to rank properties based on the total number of bookings they have received.
